### Analyze, choose, and justify the appropriate resource option for deploying the app.

As a new developer, I would choose to deploy the app using the app service because it is ideal. It removes the complications arising from deploying and setting up infrastructures as well as managing it. Because Azure manages the infrastructure as well, it can be assured that it will be highly available. Through this, in a few clicks, you can already deploy your app and see it live in minutes. It is also cost effective for beginners like me because there are free tiers that can be used ideal for learning and small projects. It is also easy to scale up with zero downtime.

### Assess app changes that would change your decision.

For me to change my decision, the complexity of the deployed application should be significant that it would require custom infratructure setups. Another reason would be the level of expertise. If the team can support deploying the application without an app service, it could be great to to minimize cost and allow for high customization.
